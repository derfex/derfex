# Projects

Hello everyone! üëã

The code that I'm proud of, with a lot of labor involved, belongs to private projects.  
My small projects are available in repositories.

## Native

First of all, I wrote a lot and for a long time on native technologies.

### [pure-tasks][pure-tasks]

Trivia in pure JS (ES5+), CSS, HTML, SVG ‚Äî test tasks from some companies.  
The results can be run in the browser, links in [`README`][pure-tasks README].

## Development notes

During the development of projects, preferences and approaches are formed.
Those that I often share, I write down in notes.

### [experience][experience]

In the article [¬´–û–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä `typeof`: –¥–µ–º–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª][experience typeof] (ru)
described an unpopular problem and its solution.

### [notes/development][notes/development]

In the article [¬´–†–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞ —Å Git¬ª][notes/development Git] (ru)
described an approach that permeates every new team I am involved with.

## Frameworks

After native JavaScript there was the company‚Äôs local framework.
Soon I wanted to try frameworks with the global community and TypeScript.

### [react-first][react-first]

I came across a lesson on React@15.

### [angular-first][angular-first]

I was more interested in Angular.
I came across lessons on it.
Later I realized that this is outdated AngularJS.

### [elaboration-vue][elaboration-vue]

Suddenly I got a job at a company where they wrote in Vue.
I studied and experimented ‚Äî stylish, succinct, modern!

### [elaboration][elaboration] (Angular)

I returned to the idea of writing in Angular with strict typing and following patterns ‚Äî important for large projects.
