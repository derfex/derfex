# Projects

Hello everyone! üëã

The code that I'm proud of, with a lot of labor involved, belongs to private projects.  
My small projects are available in repositories.

## Native

First of all, I wrote a lot and for a long time on native technologies.

### [pure-tasks](https://github.com/derfex/pure-tasks)

Trivia in pure JS (ES5+), CSS, HTML, SVG ‚Äî test tasks from some companies.  
The results can be run in the browser, links in [`README`](https://github.com/derfex/pure-tasks/blob/master/README.md).

## Development notes

During the development of projects, preferences and approaches are formed.
Those that I often share, I write down in notes.

### [experience](https://github.com/derfex/experience)

In the article [¬´–û–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä `typeof`: –¥–µ–º–æ–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –Ω–µ–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª](https://github.com/derfex/experience/tree/develop/typeof) (ru)
described an unpopular problem and its solution.

### [notes/development](https://github.com/derfex/notes/development)

In the article [¬´–†–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞ —Å Git¬ª](https://github.com/derfex/notes/blob/master/development/git.md) (ru)
described an approach that permeates every new team I am involved with.

## Frameworks

After native JavaScript there was the company‚Äôs local framework.
Soon I wanted to try frameworks with the global community and TypeScript.

### [react-first](https://github.com/derfex/react-first)

I came across a lesson on React@15.

### [angular-first](https://github.com/derfex/angular-first)

I was more interested in Angular.
I came across lessons on it.
Later I realized that this is outdated AngularJS.

### [elaboration-vue](https://github.com/derfex/elaboration-vue)

Suddenly I got a job at a company where they wrote in Vue.
I studied and experimented ‚Äî stylish, succinct, modern!

### [elaboration-angular](https://github.com/derfex/elaboration-angular)

I returned to the idea of writing in Angular with strict typing and following patterns ‚Äî important for large projects.
